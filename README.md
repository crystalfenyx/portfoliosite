# Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio site. This site is a work in progress.

I am currently enrolled in a 3-month bootcamp where I gain proficiency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Java, MySQL and more. I decided to code a site for my portfolio, and here it is. I designed the layout to be elegant and minimalist.

These are the projects I'm working on, but are not on Github yet: 

1. Fly to the Dawn: a multi-purpose for me to log and  organise my plane-spotting records, showcase my aviation calendars (e-commerce) as well as have a blog. 
2. Minute Craft: A site for a friend who knots friendship bracelets, for her to log and sort her inventory of bracelets and develop a system for her to do communications. 
3. Pandora's Box: A group project of an e-commerce site. I designed and developed (coded) the common css stylesheet and the homepage, as well as using JavaScript to input the products. 

Thank you for your understanding, as it takes much day-and-night coding to finish lots of personal projects within a bootcamp timeframe!
